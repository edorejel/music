- GTA Online: Car Steal Original Score — Gullywax https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1KxSYopCdA (*This song has two versions to it: the very fast version, and the very slow version. Playing this song on Youtube with a speed of 2.0 results in a different vibe to the song. Likewise, playing this song at a speed of 0.25 results in a different vibe. I like both versions.*)
